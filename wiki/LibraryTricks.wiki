= Introduction =

Using folders in the library it is possible to have two !TileList components on the stage each with different linkages.


= Details =

You need to change the component linkage in the Library for !TileList from fl.controls.!TileList to com.jeremyrodgers.dd_tile_list, otherwise you'll have to instantiate the dd_tile_list through code.

You can have 2 !TileList components in your library, each with a different class definition.  Make sure to put one in a folder then drag another !TileList from the Component window to the Stage, not the Library.

Here is a screenshot of what your library would look like in this case.  In this way you can still use both dd_tile_list and !TileList in the same FLA using stage instances.
